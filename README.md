## 📓 Topic : Array methods in Javascript

On the sixth day of learning javascript ,I explored **Array methods** -- powerful tools that help manipulate and work with arrays efficinetly.

## ☑️ Key concepts covered
1. forEach() executes a function once per array element.

2. map() creates a new array by applying a function to every element.

3.  filter() returns a new array with elements that pass a test.

4.  reduce() reduces the array to a single value.

5.  some practice questions for these methods to make my concepts clear and strong.

🔍 Summary
Today's focus on array methods gave me a strong foundation for handling data collections in javascript. These built-in methods make code cleaner and more expressive.
